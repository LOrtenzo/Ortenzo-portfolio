# Final Data Story

# Audience:
I made my story for movie goers age 17+ to raise awareness of the underrepresentation of women in film. I purposely chose narratives 
and visuals that spoke to their interests, and gave the startling statistics about what's happening in the hopes that they'd yield the call for change. I especially wanted to appeal to parents, and give everyone calls to action that are doable and impactful. 

# Process:
I started with a set of sketches and an idea that I'd use Tableau for my visuals. I found that I had to clarify a number of sketches, 
noted in Part 2, because they were confusing and not conveying what I hoped. As I progressed through my design, I used Infogram, which 
turned out to offer a number of advantages for iconography that helped me to create what I wanted. I also had a long learning curve with 
Tableau that I eventually mastered. Finding photos in the public domain was a challenge, because of the film topic. Ultimately, it all came together, and I'm happy with how it works. I hope you are, too. Here's a link to Shorthand [FinalProjectPart3](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/women-in-film/index.html)
