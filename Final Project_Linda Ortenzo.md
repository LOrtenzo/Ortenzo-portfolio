#Outline
Women have been underrepresented in the movie industry in front of, and behind the camera, but films that feature women in those roles have grossed high revenues, earned major awards, and told unique stories, so we all benefit from supporting their efforts. 
As a reader, I want to help equalize the number of women to men in the movie industryas soon as possible, so I can ensure that women are valued equally in American society through the stories, images, and impact of these films on children and adults.  

#Project Structure
My story arc is to use data visualizations to show the underrepresentation of women in film, both in front of, and behind the camera from 2000 - 2020 with a focus on 2010 - 2020. This includes roles for women, and female writers and directors.
